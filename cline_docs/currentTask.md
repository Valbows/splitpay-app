# Current Task: Implement Backend Data Transformation

## Objective

Implement the data transformation layer in the backend to convert UUIDs to integer IDs and format data for the frontend, as per the provided instructions. This includes creating a `transformers.js` utility file, modifying existing API endpoints to use the transformers, and implementing any necessary new endpoints.

## Context

The frontend requires integer IDs for data objects, while the Supabase database uses UUIDs. A data transformation layer is needed in the backend to bridge this gap. The provided instructions outline a hybrid approach involving a transformation utility and updating API endpoints.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` to reflect the completion of the backend data transformation phase.
2.  Review `cline_docs/lessonsLearned.md` and add any relevant lessons learned during this implementation phase.
3.  Update `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md` (already completed in previous steps).
4.  Inform the user that this phase of the backend updates is complete and is ready for testing.

## Success Criteria

*   `backend/src/utils/transformers.js` file is created with the specified transformation functions.
*   Existing API endpoints in `backend/src/index.js` correctly use the transformation functions to return integer IDs and formatted data.
*   The `GET /api/users/me` endpoint is implemented and returns user data in the frontend format with integer IDs.
*   Documentation files (`cline_docs/apiEndpoints.md`, `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`, `cline_docs/currentTask.md`, `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`) are updated to reflect the changes.
