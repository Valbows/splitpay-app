- Create Group flow (Process 1, Screen 3)
- Group Detail page (Process 2, Screen 1)
- New Expenses page (Process 2, Screen 2)
- Add Expense Form (Process 2, Screen 3)
- Expenses list (Process 2, Screen 4)
- Split Details (Process 3, Screen 1)

âœ… **API SERVICE LAYER:**
- Complete API service with Users, Groups, and Expenses endpoints
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling and HTTP methods

## Process Flow Analysis

### Process 1: Initial Action / Entry Point

#### Screen 1: Dashboard (Entry Point)
**Location:** `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
**Current State:** âœ… Implemented
**Database Requirements:**
```sql
-- Overview Cards Data
SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN user_balance > 0 THEN user_balance ELSE 0 END) as total_balance,
  COUNT(DISTINCT group_id) as active_groups,
  COUNT(*) as pending_actions,
  SUM(settled_amount) as settled_payments
FROM user_group_balances 
WHERE user_id = ?

-- Recent Activity Feed
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM activities 
WHERE user_id = ? 
ORDER BY created_at DESC

-- Chart Data (Spending Trends)
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, SUM(amount) as total 
FROM expenses 
WHERE user_id = ? AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)

-- Pending Payments Chart
SELECT g.name, SUM(e.amount) as pending_amount
FROM groups g 
JOIN expenses e ON g.id = e.group_id 
WHERE e.settled = false AND e.paid_by_user_id != ?
GROUP BY g.id, g.name
```

**Integration Status:** ðŸš§ NEEDS BACKEND HOOKS
- OverviewCards component uses static data
- ChartSection component uses mock data
- RecentActivity component uses static data

#### Decision Point: View Existing vs Create New
**Current State:** âœ… Implemented via navigation
- Green path: Navigate to Groups page (`/groups`)
- Alternative path: Navigate to Create Group (`/create-group`)

#### Screen 2: Groups Page (Existing Groups)
**Location:** `/src/pages/Groups.tsx`
**Current State:** âœ… Implemented
**Database Requirements:**
```sql
-- User's Groups
SELECT g.*, gm.role, gm.joined_at

WHERE gm.user_id = ?

-- Group Activity Summary
SELECT 
  g.id,
  g.name,
  g.description,
  CASE 
    WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN e.paid_by_user_id = ? THEN e.amount ELSE 0 END) > 
         SUM(CASE WHEN s.user_id = ? THEN s.amount ELSE 0 END) 
    THEN 'owed'
    ELSE 'owe'
  END as balance_type,
  ABS(SUM(CASE WHEN e.paid_by_user_id = ? THEN e.amount ELSE 0 END) - 
      SUM(CASE WHEN s.user_id = ? THEN s.amount ELSE 0 END)) as balance_amount
FROM groups g
LEFT JOIN expenses e ON g.id = e.group_id
LEFT JOIN expense_splits s ON e.id = s.expense_id
WHERE g.id IN (SELECT group_id FROM group_members WHERE user_id = ?)
GROUP BY g.id
```

**Integration Status:** ðŸš§ NEEDS BACKEND HOOKS

#### Screen 3: Create Group Flow
**Location:** `/src/pages/CreateGroup.tsx`
**Current State:** âœ… Implemented (4-step wizard)
**Database Requirements:**
```sql

INSERT INTO groups (name, description, created_by_user_id) 
VALUES (?, ?, ?)

-- Add creator as admin
INSERT INTO group_members (group_id, user_id, role) 
VALUES (?, ?, 'admin')

-- Create invitation links
INSERT INTO group_invitations (group_id, invited_by_user_id, invitation_code, expires_at)

### Next Steps for Backend Integration

1. **Replace Static Data with API Calls:**
   - Update OverviewCards to fetch real dashboard metrics
   - Update Groups page to fetch user's actual groups
   - Update all components to use React hooks for data fetching

2. **Add State Management:**
   - Implement React Query or SWR for data fetching
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Add optimistic updates for better UX

3. **Enhance API Service:**
   - Add dashboard metrics endpoint
   - Add group member management endpoints
   - Add expense splitting endpoints
   - Add invitation management endpoints

4. **Add Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication
   - Add protected routes
   - Add user context/session management
